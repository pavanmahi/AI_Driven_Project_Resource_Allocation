"It might be challenging for readers to get their hands on the books they want to read. The problem relies on their ability to get hold of the book, either because it is unavailable, expensive, or has a limited number of prints available. There are times when other people have these books, but for a variety of reasonsÃ¢ÂÂsuch as the fact that they have already finished reading or are no longer interested in readingÃ¢ÂÂthese books are of no use to them. Thus, we aim to solve the problem of book readers by sharing a model that can help these people share the desired books with the readers efficiently.

ShareBook App is an android project that is designed to solve the book-sharing problem of students or the common public in general. It provides a platform for any user, who has a book that is not needed anymore and would like to share it with another user that may have the need for it. The user can either purchase the book they need or sell the book that they donÃ¢ÂÂt need anymore.

In this android system, the admin g in to view the list of users using the app. The admins are able to block and unblock any user they want. They can also view the list of the books added by the users for auction.

The user here can register first to log in to their account. They can view their profile after they log in. They can also change the password whenever they want. If the user is interested in buying a book, they can search for the name or description of the book added by the other users. They can add or remove any book from the cart. After buying a particular book, the user can check out the list, details and status of the book they have purchased. The user can hold an online auction if they wish to sell a specific collection of unique and authentic books or comics that are not widely available or only come in a limited number of prints.

They can add, update, view and delete any book they want. The other users interested can bid on the auctioned book. The user can view the bid list and the winner of the auction as well. Similarly, the user can bid on auctions put up by others as well.","it might be challenging for readers to get their hands on the books they want to read the problem relies on their ability to get hold of the book either because it is unavailable expensive or has a limited number of prints available there are times when other people have these books but for a variety of reasonssuch as the fact that they have already finished reading or are no longer interested in readingthese books are of no use to them thus we aim to solve the problem of book readers by sharing a model that can help these people share the desired books with the readers efficiently

"With increased responsibility, it has become difficult for people to keep track of the number and quantity of groceries available. Thus, a poor grocery management system leads to the problem of not having enough groceries when required. In this fast world, remembering the groceries in the kitchen is really a tough job for people who are involved in jobs away from home. A smart grocery management system is in demand to keep track of the availability of grocery items in the kitchens at home.

We have designed an Android Grocery Management App to tackle the above-mentioned problem. Our project will help to keep track of the grocery available. It can be applied anywhere where an efficient management system is required, like homes, stores, restaurants, etc. To enhance the user experience, we have also added a recipe feature which will help the user to make interesting and delicious food items with the available grocery in the inventory.

The system comprises 1 module: User.
The user would require to register first to log in. After registering successfully, the user can log in using their credentials. If the user forgets their password, the system will send the existing password to their email. The user will have the access to add, update and view items in their inventory.

The system will even suggest recipes to the user based on the items available in their inventory. The system will show the recipes by searching 60% of ingredients that matches the items in the inventory. In the recipe ingredients, the system will also show how much quantity is required and how much quantity of ingredients is available.

The user can view the list of all the recipes included by them as well as the others. While adding ingredients to the recipe, they can either choose from the items already available in the inventory or add a new one. They can also edit and delete any recipes they have added.

The user can scan the barcode of any item, if that item is available in the inventory, they can update it or else the system will ask them to add it to the list. In the Shopping list, the user can manage the items they want to shop for in their inventory.","with increased responsibility it has become difficult for people to keep track of the number and quantity of groceries available thus a poor grocery management system leads to the problem of not having enough groceries when required in this fast world remembering the groceries in the kitchen is really a tough job for people who are involved in jobs away from home a smart grocery management system is in demand to keep track of the availability of grocery items in the kitchens at home

"Given the drawbacks of traditional English pronunciation correction systems, such as failure to provide timely feedback and correct learnersÃ¢ÂÂ pronunciation errors, slow improvement of learnersÃ¢ÂÂ English proficiency, and even misleading learners, it is critical to developing a scientific and efficient automatic correction system for English pronunciation errors.

Our Automatic Pronunciation Mistake Detection project is an efficient automatic correction system for English pronunciation errors. It is designed to enable students/user to improve their pronunciation skills. By using Speech recognition, pyaudio and pyttsx3, the project aims to efficiently diminish the error rate and enhance the accuracy of error detection.

This python-based project consists of 2 major modules, including User and Admin. The user would require to register first by filling in their name, age, gender, standard and username & password of their choice. The user would then need to log in to use the site.

For pronunciation detection, tser would need to select the word they want to pronounce and record it. The pronunciation mistake will be recognized by comparing the word entered and the conversion of the recorded word to text. If it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt match it will give a pop-up as wrong pronunciation. The user can view the words pronounced and can hear the correct pronunciation of the word they had pronounced wrong, by clicking on the audio file. The admin has the access to view the usersÃ¢ÂÂ details and their pronunciation mistakes.

"A sizeable portion of the population uses some sort of bus service to commute to their workplace, college, school, etc. The commuters who travel on a frequent basis prefer to use a bus pass instead of getting a ticket as it is both cheaper and convenient. However, renewing the pass often requires a traveller to wait in long queues to renew their pass often making it inconvenient and negating the benefits of holding a pass. Passengers also need to carry and present their pass daily in order to avail the benefits.

Moreover, a simple paper-based pass can be easily forged. Thereby, causing a significant loss of business for bus service operators. This Android Bus Pass Management System has been developed to help both passengers as well bus operators and simplifying the process of bus pass management. This system allows passengers to renew their pass by making payment through the app itself. The renewed pass is stored in the app itself for easy access.

Moreover, this systemÃ¢ÂÂs user-friendly interface makes it me accessible. Thereby ensuring that people who struggle with technology find it approachable. User will have to create an account in order to use the bus pass system. User can create a new pass or renew an existing one if it has expired.

To create a new Pass, user will have to select source, destination, pass duration and payment method. Payment method in this app is just for a demonstration purpose having a variety of modes for the payment. The Existing pass of the user can be downloaded in order to show it to any authorized person for validation of the travel without being able to login and worry about internet connection.","a sizeable portion of the population uses some sort of bus service to commute to their workplace college school etc the commuters who travel on a frequent basis prefer to use a bus pass instead of getting a ticket as it is both cheaper and convenient however renewing the pass often requires a traveller to wait in long queues to renew their pass often making it inconvenient and negating the benefits of holding a pass passengers also need to carry and present their pass daily in order to avail the benefits

"We have designed an Online Voting System in Python to tackle the existing problem of elections in various spaces. It is a web-based voting system that will help to manage elections easily and securely. This voting system can be used for casting votes during elections held in universities and organizations. In this system, the voter does not have to go to the polling booth to cast their vote. They can use their personal computer for doing so. The system can be used anywhere. It is not just employed for national elections; it may also be used for any sort of elections required.

The system comprises 2 modules: User and Admin.
The admin can log in using their credentials. They will have the access to add, update, delete and view elections. They can also add candidates. They can either choose candidates from the registered users or add new ones. They can view the votes cast by the users and the winner of the elections.

The user would require to register first to access the system. They can log in using their credentials. They can manage their profile and change their passwords. The users can view both the ongoing and expired elections along with their details and candidates. For ongoing elections, the user can cast their votes and for expired elections, they can view the winners.","we have designed an online voting system in python to tackle the existing problem of elections in various spaces it is a webbased voting system that will help to manage elections easily and securely this voting system can be used for casting votes during elections held in universities and organizations in this system the voter does not have to go to the polling booth to cast their vote they can use their personal computer for doing so the system can be used anywhere it is not just employed for national elections it may also be used for any sort of elections required

"Our Flutter-Based Blood Donation System offers functionalities for quick access to donor records collected from various parts of the country. It enables monitoring of the results and performance of the blood donation activity such that relevant and measurable objectives of the organization can be checked. They are providing an efficient search for who needs the blood in their own city as fast as possible. The donor can also easily keep track of the donation they made.

Our system comprises 4 modules: User (Registered), User (Unregistered), Institution and Admin.

The registered user would require to register using their government ID and profile photo. If they forget their password, they can check it using 2-factor authentication. They can log in using their credentials. They can manage and change their passwords. On the dashboard, the users can view feeds, news and statistics. They can also view their goals, achievement, leaderboard and the last blood donated date. To become a blood donation volunteer, they will require to take the pre-screen test before blood donation.

They can become a donor after taking the test. They can view the nearby NGOs and Blood Donation Camps and their details on the map. They can even search for it by using different filters. The users can view the list of blood requests sent by the institutions with the options to accept or reject. They can also view the blood donations made by them in the past. The users can receive notifications about camps, emergency blood requirements or more. They can also turn on and off the push notification alerts. They will also receive a reminder notification. It will show that the previous donation has surpassed 3 months.

The unregistered users can view the nearby NGOs and Blood Donation Camps and their details on the map. They can even search for it by using different filters. On the dashboard, they can view feeds, news and statistics. They can even receive Push Notification alerts.

The institution admin would require to register first through a unique ID which will be sent by email. They can log in using their credentials. They can manage their profile and change the password if they want. They can view the list of all the donors. They have the access to call, message or notify the users. They can also view all the appointments and update the status. The institution admin can view the donors with similar blood types. They can view very few details about the donors only if they have accepted the request. It is to protect the identity of the donor. They can manage the blood requests. They can view all the blood banks. They can create notifications and alerts to advertise Blood Donation Camps, Blood Shortages, and more.

The admin can log in using their credentials. They can view the total number of blood donors, requests, banks and cities. They will have the access to authorize the institution admin. They can send a new push notification or add new notifications for display. They can manage feeds, news, goals and statistics for users. They view the number of users on top of the leaderboard. They can manage the questions and scores for the pre-screen test and view the number of pre-screen tests attempted by users.

For this system, Flutter is used on the front end and Dart is used as the programming language. The IDE is Android Studio and the back end is Firebase. For push notifications, we have used FCM. Firebase Cloud Messaging is a messaging solution that allows websites and mobile applications to send push notifications to subscribers.","our flutterbased blood donation system offers functionalities for quick access to donor records collected from various parts of the country it enables monitoring of the results and performance of the blood donation activity such that relevant and measurable objectives of the organization can be checked they are providing an efficient search for who needs the blood in their own city as fast as possible the donor can also easily keep track of the donation they made

"Our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain systems using smart contracts can have a wide range of applications across the pharmaceutical industry. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into the code. They can be used to automate the process of supply chain management and reduce costs, increase transparency and accountability, and improve patient safety.

The system comprises 6 modules: Admin, Supplier, Manufacturer, Wholesaler, Distributor and Customer.

The admin can log in using their credentials. They can manage the Supplier, Transporter Manufacturer, Wholesaler, and Distributor and create and assign smart contracts to them. They will have to approve the customerÃ¢ÂÂs account and create and assign smart contracts. The admin can view the supply chain of each order along with the transaction and block details.

"Our project, Smart Campus Surveillance-Based Guidance System, is designed to help universities have an access to an advanced surveillance system to guide students to their classes accordingly. It will help in monitoring students wandering in and around the campus and assist them in their respective classrooms.

In this project, the front end includes Html, CSS, and JavaScript and the back end includes Python. The database used is MySQL. The framework used is Django.

This Python-based project aims to improve security on and around campus. It just has one module in which the system is managed by the admin. The admin must manually enter data into the system. They have to include all class details, such as the wing and floor where the class is located and the direction to the class. They also need to add class and break times in order to manage and help students appropriately.

The admin then needs to enter information about the students with their photos and assign classes to them. The admin also has to add details about each camera placed on the campus, including the wing and floor where they are placed.

To start the surveillance, the admin has to choose the camera they want to check. If the camera captures a student outside the class, it will recognize the studentÃ¢ÂÂs face and the system will verify their class details. If the student is not on the same floor or wing as their class, the system will make use of the speaker to read out the directions to them.
If the student is on the same floor or wing as their class, the system will check their class & break timings and will ask them to return to their class while reading out their class directions through the speaker. The admin can view student logs from the surveillance system.

Directions will not be as per GPS or indoor navigation since the camera is at a fixed place and cannot navigate a class because we donÃ¢ÂÂt have studentsÃ¢ÂÂ real-time loc","our project smart campus surveillancebased guidance system is designed to help universities have an access to an advanced surveillance system to guide students to their classes accordingly it will help in monitoring students wandering in and around the campus and assist them in their respective classrooms

"The E consultation system is an end user support and online consultation project. Here we propose a system that connects patients to available doctors for online consultation and also allows doctors to email subscriptions in printable format. Our proposed system aims to build an environment where various patients needing doctor help at their home can consult doctors, send their images(for skin diseases/beauty related issues), chat with doctors, tell then their issues and discuss remedies. It also consists of a doctors login panel where doctor may login to the system and then see patient requests for consultations. The system then schedules those requests and serves them to doctor one after another. This allows doctors to chat with patients and discuss their problems. At the end of consultation the doctor may send them an online subscription in a printable word format so that they may directly print it and get medicines based on that prescription. The system will prove helpful to urgent cases that do not reach hospital, for emergency cases that do not have doctors in area, during late night emergencies and also for preliminary examination of patients.",the e consultation system is an end user support and online consultation project here we propose a system that connects patients to available doctors for online consultation and also allows doctors to email subscriptions in printable format our proposed system aims to build an environment where various patients needing doctor help at their home can consult doctors send their imagesfor skin diseasesbeauty related issues chat with doctors tell then their issues and discuss remedies it also consists of a doctors login panel where doctor may login to the system and then see patient requests for consultations the system then schedules those requests and serves them to doctor one after another this allows doctors to chat with patients and discuss their problems at the end of consultation the doctor may send them an online subscription in a printable word format so that they may directly print it and get medicines based on that prescription the system will prove helpful to urgent cases that do not reach hospital for emergency cases that do not have doctors in area during late night emergencies and also for preliminary examination of patients,"{

"Ambulance Booking System
The Ambulance Booking System is designed to provide a fast and efficient way for users to book ambulances and find nearby hospitals in case of emergencies. The system consists of three major modules: User, Ambulance, and Hospital, ensuring seamless coordination between patients, ambulance services, and hospitals.

To use the system, a user must register and log in using a username and password. Once authenticated, they can book an ambulance by selecting the ambulance size, pick-up point, hospital, date, and time. In case of an emergency, the system automatically assigns the nearest available ambulance and hospital, ensuring a quick response. Users can also view their previous bookings and update their profile or password as needed.

When an ambulance booking request is made, it is sent to the ambulance driver and the hospital representative for approval. The ambulance driver must register and log in to access their account. After logging in, they can view booking requests, check nearby hospitals, and review their previous bookings. The driver can either accept or decline a booking request based on availability.

Similarly, hospitals must register and log in to the system. Once authenticated, the hospital representative can view ambulance booking requests and choose to accept or decline the request. Users can also browse nearby hospitals to select the most suitable medical facility for their needs.","ambulance booking system

"Blockchain-Based Rental Property System
The Blockchain-Based Rental Property System is designed to digitize and secure property leasing transactions using smart contracts and blockchain technology. By eliminating fraudulent listings, arbitrary charges, and false rental agreements, the system ensures transparent, automated, and tamper-proof property rentals for landlords and tenants.

The system consists of three key user roles: Admin, Landlord, and Tenant.

The Admin oversees the entire system, managing landlord and tenant accounts by approving, blocking, or deleting users. They have access to all feedback and ratings, ensuring the platform maintains high standards of trust and credibility. Additionally, the Cirrus Core Wallet Dashboard allows admins to monitor blockchain transactions, user wallet balances, and contract details, ensuring a secure and decentralized rental ecosystem.

The Landlord registers to list and manage rental properties, ensuring verified and accurate property information. They can add, update, or remove listings, manage rental contracts, and automate rent collection and refunds using smart contracts. The landlord can also track tenant details, review rent transactions, and provide ratings and feedback on tenant behavior.

The Tenant browses available properties, applying filters based on rental amount and location. They can request to rent a property, initiate secure payments, and receive real-time confirmation from the landlord. Once a lease agreement is finalized, the smart contract ensures automated rent payments, contract termination, and deposit handling. Tenants can also rate and review landlords, contributing to the trustworthiness of the system.

Built using Cirrus Core Wallet and Cirrus API, the system ensures privacy, security, and transparency in all property transactions. The blockchain ledger records all transactions, eliminating fraud and unauthorized modifications. By automating lease agreements, rent collection, and dispute resolution, this system enhances efficiency, security, and trust in the housing rental market.

"Blockchain-Based Merchant Payment System
The Blockchain-Based Merchant Payment System is designed to provide secure, transparent, and efficient online transactions between customers and merchants. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures tamper-proof transaction records, easy payment processing, and improved financial transparency for both businesses and consumers.

If a customer opts for a ""pay later"" option, the merchant can track outstanding balances and send payment reminders to customers. The merchant also has access to customer feedback and suggestions, helping improve service and user experience.

The Customer can make secure payments to merchants by entering their bank details and payment amount. They have full access to their transaction history, including any pending payments. Customers can also receive notifications from merchants regarding due payments and have the ability to provide feedback or suggestions based on their experience.","blockchainbased merchant payment system

The Accounts Department plays a crucial role in verifying and analyzing financial data. They have access to income details of all employees as well as expense reports generated by accountants. They can compare current and past financial records, helping the organization track financial performance over time. Any modifications to records are logged and flagged to ensure transparency.

The Employees are an implicit entity in the system, as their income details are tracked and stored within financial records. Employees can share feedback about the system or provide financial improvement suggestions, indirectly influencing budgeting and cost-saving strategies.","the blockchainbased organization financial tracking system is designed to provide secure transparent and efficient financial tracking for businesses by leveraging blockchain technology the system ensures that income and expense records remain tamperproof enabling organizations to forecast finances identify costcutting opportunities and plan for growth with confidence

The Admin manages the entire system, including registering helpdesk team members, assigning tasks, and tracking issue resolutions. They can view, accept, or reject user requests, ensuring that only valid complaints or queries are processed. Once an issue is resolved, it is automatically removed from the active list, but admins can still review completed requests and user feedback.

The Helpdesk Representative is responsible for handling service requests assigned by the admin. They can view, update, and resolve tasks while tracking their progress. They can also filter issues by date or user ID, ensuring efficient task management.

The User can submit service requests with a detailed problem description, track the status of their requests, and filter results by date, request ID, or status. Once an issue is resolved, users can provide feedback on the service received, contributing to continuous improvement in customer support.","online helpdesk system

Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. However, since weather is unpredictable most of the times not all of these predictions prove reliable.

This Weather Monitor App provides the user with real time weather information. This system is dynamic and updated on an hourly basis thus allowing to keep up with the ever-changing weather.
Moreover, this system works globally thereby proving to be an extremely efficient tool for both tourists, as well as frequent travelers.

"Voting is a method for a group of individuals to make a collective decision or voice their cumulative opinion to arrive at a consensus. The results of a vote can have far reaching consequences due to which it is imperative to maintain integrity by ensuring that there is no scope for fraud or cheating to occur while the votes are being cast. It is highly crucial that voting is carried out in a fair and just manner.

This Electronic Voting System has been developed to help eliminate any chance of tampering and improve the reliability and dependability of a voting system. This system consists of two entities namely; The Admin and The Voter (The User).

Once the Voter has logged in to the system using their valid username and password, they can view the upcoming elections and the candidates contesting the election. Users can also view results once the elections have concluded. This system also shows user the elections that they have participated in so far.

On the other side of the application, the admin can view the list of candidates contesting, the list of voters, and the list of elections. Since this system maintains the data using blockchain, it is highly dependable and can be easily scanned to check for signs of tampering and malpractice.

In this system, the admin is the sole authority to manage elections, candidates and voters. Admin can also view the votes. Admin can also check if any vote is tampered, thus checking and verifying the block. Voter can view Elections and cast their vote, also can view the winner but cannot see the winning ratio or votes etc. The system uses Blockchain technology to create a block of every vote thus protecting its identity.","voting is a method for a group of individuals to make a collective decision or voice their cumulative opinion to arrive at a consensus the results of a vote can have far reaching consequences due to which it is imperative to maintain integrity by ensuring that there is no scope for fraud or cheating to occur while the votes are being cast it is highly crucial that voting is carried out in a fair and just manner

"Taking out some time from your busy schedule to attend a gym daily for a workout seems difficult for working professionals & college students due to workload & studies. As a result of which many people prefer doing exercises or gym workouts at their home itself. However, a gym workout or exercise done without following the right procedure or positions and done without the proper guidance of a trainer can damage your muscles. Also, hiring a personal trainer may not fit everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs budget.

So, to tackle this issue we have developed an android based GYM Buddy application that will act as a virtual trainer. This application will guide the users on various body exercises with step-by-step positions with images. The users can keep a track of the data of day-to-day exercises. The Gym Buddy application contains a list of all exercises based on different types & categories (i.e., workout for Abs, Chest, Biceps, etc.).

The users can also keep a track of how much sets or weights they used in one particular workout sohat they can increase or decrease its capacity accordingly. Thus, this android-based gym workout application will act as a virtual guide to the users & will provide a user-friendly gym experience.

In this system, the user will be able to view all kinds of exercises based on type or category. Each Workout or exercise is well explained in details along with 2 photos showing the start and end pose, so that user can check his posture like in the photo and can imitate it properly. User can enter weight or set based on current date and can add multiple entries for each date. All the exercise data has to be directly added in the code, there are no modules to manage them and backend used is SQLite.","taking out some time from your busy schedule to attend a gym daily for a workout seems difficult for working professionals  college students due to workload  studies as a result of which many people prefer doing exercises or gym workouts at their home itself however a gym workout or exercise done without following the right procedure or positions and done without the proper guidance of a trainer can damage your muscles also hiring a personal trainer may not fit everyones budget

"As we still continue to battle the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, it has become very difficult for college students to keep in touch with the faculties & professors to get their problems solved. Earlier we had to personally visit the college and had to meet the concerned person to get our queries solved, but the ongoing pandemic has brought a complete halt to this approach & switching to an alternative method has become a dire need nowadays. Also, it has become very difficult for the college management to convey any important notice or message to all the students as all the college faculty members & students may not be using the same messaging app.
Hence to solve this issue we have come up with an android based College Connect Chat application where all the students & teachers can stay connected together on a single platform, thereby helping all the students to be in constant touch with the faculties and making it possible for them to get their problems solved in an instant. Hence, this android based application will help students to be in contact with their fellow mates & professors all the time without being physically present in a classroom.

This system is basically a kind of forum where teachers and faculties can come together and share their view. The Admin is the College here who is responsible to create profiles of all the students and faculties.

"Touring has become a very important part of our life. By taking a nap from our daily work life we often want to prefer spending some time somewhere along a sea coast or on a hill station and be at complete peace. But planning a tour all by ourselves is a very difficult & time-consuming task. Generally, while planning for a tour, we often prefer taking recommendations from our friends, but these suggestions are often limited to the places they have visited.

Also, the suggestions taken from travel agents are sometimes biased as their objective is to sell their packages & make money out of them. Furthermore, doing our own research over the vast internet for tour planning leaves the user even more frustrated & confused to come towards a definite conclusion as there are tons of websites to browse through on the web. Hence it is necessary to come up with an automated user-friendly solution for tour recommendations for solving this issue. Tourism has always been an integral part of many countriesÃ¢ÂÂ economy across e globe. Therefore, it has become very important to attract different tourists from all over the world, for which we can utilize the vast data available on the internet by using data mining & data science for generating user-friendly results based on oneÃ¢ÂÂs interest for people surfing for tour planning on the internet. To solve this, we at Nevon Projects have come up with a Tour Recommendation System using collaborative filtering which will generate user-friendly preferences & recommendations.

The rapidly growing usage of the web and its applications has become a major source of userÃ¢ÂÂs information available on the internet. This information can be easily utilized to understand different userÃ¢ÂÂs persona based on their internet activity using data mining techniques and thus by identifying their interest we can suggest them various offers based on their preferences. Hence this recommender system can be very helpful in attracting the tourist by recommending them the right options to choose from, thereby incr the rate of conversion significantly.

This tour recommending system will play an important role in generating user-friendly results by analysing the userÃ¢ÂÂs online activity and collecting information related to their interests & locations. This system based on data science is developed as an online application, which is capable of producing a personalized list of recommendations by mining & analysing the userÃ¢ÂÂs data from their social network data history to perform better analysis & predictions.

In this system, the user can make a day plan by selecting his list of places based on his preferences of Food & place type. There can be any number of plans made and all the places are fetched using Google place API and based on Highest rating. The Plan considered your total number of hours added, so that it can calculate your travelling time + time spend on a particular location. The final places can be manually sorted by the user or can use auto sort to get the proper route. The system will give suggestions ofces where and when required based on other users plans.","touring has become a very important part of our life by taking a nap from our daily work life we often want to prefer spending some time somewhere along a sea coast or on a hill station and be at complete peace but planning a tour all by ourselves is a very difficult  timeconsuming task generally while planning for a tour we often prefer taking recommendations from our friends but these suggestions are often limited to the places they have visited

"Modern day-to-day life of people in major cities is very demanding and the schedules are equally hectic. In such times, it is practically impossible to keep a track of all the activities/ appointments. Many a times, it happens that we may miss an important task; for example: taking medicines, attending a meeting, returning library books, paying the bills etc. And this cycle can keep going on endlessly. The human mind is not designed to multitask, it needs to work things out one at a time. This requires us to maintain our focus on the task at hand, and as a result other important things take a backstage and some may even slip out of our minds. In order to address this problem, we have come up with a Weekly Task Alerting System. This system is designed to alert the user of all the important tasks that are due on a specific day, every week. So now, the user can carry on with his/her life without any worries. The developed project is a tasks reminder app, with AI-powered Chatbot that will make user enjoy productivity. Whether your goal is to make good habits or get rid of bad ones. This application helps you to make sure that the tasks you set actually get done, with the help of its AI assistant. It monitors your android phone, pings you at times youÃ¢ÂÂre likely to see a notification and makes sure you donÃ¢ÂÂt forget about items on your to-do list.

Any known algorithm has a probability of being cracked. So hence we here propose a configurable algorithm that allows user to modify the algorithm each time he encrypts text. The algorithm uses AES and adds some custom configurable steps in the system where user may modify the encryption process as needed.

"The mobile attendance system has been built to eliminate the time and effort wasted in taking attendances in schools and colleges. It also greatly reduces the amount of paper resources needed in attendance data management. The system is divided into following modules:
This is an android mobile app. ItÃ¢ÂÂs built to be used for school/college faculty so that they may take student attendance on their phones.
Student Attendance List Creation: Once this App is installed on a phone, a it allows user to create a student attendance sheet consisting of name, roll number, date, Absent/Present mark and subject. He has to fill student names along with associated roll numbers.
Attendance Marking: The faculty has the list on his phone now. He may see the list call roll numbers and select absent id the student is absent or select present if student is present.
Attendance Storage: This data is now stored in the faculty mobile phone. Faculty may also view it anytime on their phone.
Attendance sheet transfer: The faculty can tnsfer the file to a server (normal computer) via an internet connection where this data can be stored and maintained by the school or college.
Attendance Check: The PC operator may now check the attendance transferred as Student roll no, date, time and sort by date to check presentees and absentees of a particular date.
Thus this system automates attendance system and eliminates the use of paperwork needed for attendance marking and monitoring student attendance.","the mobile attendance system has been built to eliminate the time and effort wasted in taking attendances in schools and colleges it also greatly reduces the amount of paper resources needed in attendance data management the system is divided into following modules

The proposed project is a system that keeps a track of employeesÃ¢ÂÂ attendance using barcode scanner. This concept set forth to automate the traditional attendance system of taking signature by using authentication technique. The traditional system requires a register maintained for manually signing the attendance by the employees which is time consuming. Hence this proposed project eliminates the need of maintaining attendance sheet.The proposed system uses barcode method for authenticating employees with a unique barcode that represents their unique id. Every employee will have their attendance card. They have to scan their cards using barcode scanner and the system notes down their attendance as per date and time. System stores employeeÃ¢ÂÂs attendance details and generates brief report for admin as required. Such kind of application is very useful in organizations or corporations for taking daily attenda,the proposed project is a system that keeps a track of employees attendance using barcode scanner this concept set forth to automate the traditional attendance system of taking signature by using authentication technique the traditional system requires a register maintained for manually signing the attendance by the employees which is time consuming hence this proposed project eliminates the need of maintaining attendance sheetthe proposed system uses barcode method for authenticating employees with a unique barcode that represents their unique id every employee will have their attendance card they have to scan their cards using barcode scanner and the system notes down their attendance as per date and time system stores employees attendance details and generates brief report for admin as required such kind of application is very useful in organizations or corporations for taking daily attenda,"{'entities': [{'name': 'Employee', 'attributes': ['unique_id', 'attendance_card']}, {'name': 'AttendanceRecord', 'attributes': ['date', 'time', 'employee_unique_id']}, {'name': 'Admin', 'attributes': []}], 'relationships': [{'from': 'Employee', 'to': 'AttendanceRecord', 'label': 'Attended'}, {'from': 'Employee', 'to': 'AttendanceCard', 'label': 'Has'}]}"

"Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. However, not all of these predictions prove reliable. Here this system will predict weather based on parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind. This system is a web application with effective graphical user interface. User will login to the system using his user ID and password. User will enter current temperature; humidity and wind, System will take this parameter and will predict weather from previous data in database. The role of the admin is to add previous weather data in database, so that system will calculate weather based on these data. Weather forecasting system takes parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind and will forecast weather based on previous record therefore this prediction will prove reliable.

"In this project we analyse how business intelligence on a website could be obtained from userÃ¢ÂÂs access records instead of web logs of Ã¢ÂÂhitsÃ¢ÂÂ. UserÃ¢ÂÂs access records are captured by implementing a data mining algorithm on the website. User mostly browses those products in which he is interested. This system will capture userÃ¢ÂÂs browsing pattern using data mining algorithm. This system is a web application where user can view various resources on the website. User will register their profile in an exchange of a password. User will get user ID and password in order to access the system. Once the user loginÃ¢ÂÂs to the system user will gain access to certain resources on the website. The links to the resources on the website have been modified such that a record of information about the access would be recorded in the database when clicked. This way, data mining can be performed on a relatively clean set of access records about the users. When user clicks on certain resources on the website his access recocaptured by the system this can be achieved with the help of data mining algorithm used in this system. By using this application, product based organization will get to know the demand for certain products. This system will help organization to target right consumers. This system will help product based firms to maintain good customer relationship. Hence, a good deal of business intelligence about the usersÃ¢ÂÂ behaviours, preferences and about the popularities of the resources (products) on the website can be gaine",in this project we analyse how business intelligence on a website could be obtained from users access records instead of web logs of hits users access records are captured by implementing a data mining algorithm on the website user mostly browses those products in which he is interested this system will capture users browsing pattern using data mining algorithm this system is a web application where user can view various resources on the website user will register their profile in an exchange of a password user will get user id and password in order to access the system once the user logins to the system user will gain access to certain resources on the website the links to the resources on the website have been modified such that a record of information about the access would be recorded in the database when clicked this way data mining can be performed on a relatively clean set of access records about the users when user clicks on certain resources on the website his access recocaptured by the system this can be achieved with the help of data mining algorithm used in this system by using this application product based organization will get to know the demand for certain products this system will help organization to target right consumers this system will help product based firms to maintain good customer relationship hence a good deal of business intelligence about the users behaviours preferences and about the popularities of the resources products on the website can be gaine,"{

"People now-a-days are very fond of using internet as a discussion medium. As internet technology had been increasing more and more, this technology led to many legal and illegal activities. It is found that much first-hand news has been discussed in Internet forums well before they are reported in traditional mass media. This communication channel provides an effective channel for illegal activities such as dissemination of copyrighted movies, threatening messages and online gambling etc. The law enforcement agencies are looking for solutions to monitor these discussion forums for possible criminal activities and download suspected postings as evidence for investigation. We propose a system which will tackle this problem effectively. In this project we had used a data mining algorithm to detect criminal activities and illegal postings. Our proposed system will download postings from selected discussion forums continuously and employ data mining techniques to identify hot topics and cluster authors into different groups using word-based user profiles. This system will use text data mining technique. This system monitors and analysis online plain text sources such as Internet news, blogs, etc. for security purposes. This is done with the help of text mining concept. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends. System will analyze online plain text sources from selected discussion forums and will classify the text into different groups and system will decide which post is legal and illegal. This system will help to reduce many illegal activities which are held on internet.",people nowadays are very fond of using internet as a discussion medium as internet technology had been increasing more and more this technology led to many legal and illegal activities it is found that much firsthand news has been discussed in internet forums well before they are reported in traditional mass media this communication channel provides an effective channel for illegal activities such as dissemination of copyrighted movies threatening messages and online gambling etc the law enforcement agencies are looking for solutions to monitor these discussion forums for possible criminal activities and download suspected postings as evidence for investigation we propose a system which will tackle this problem effectively in this project we had used a data mining algorithm to detect criminal activities and illegal postings our proposed system will download postings from selected discussion forums continuously and employ data mining techniques to identify hot topics and cluster authors into different groups using wordbased user profiles this system will use text data mining technique this system monitors and analysis online plain text sources such as internet news blogs etc for security purposes this is done with the help of text mining concept highquality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends system will analyze online plain text sources from selected discussion forums and will classify the text into different groups and system will decide which post is legal and illegal this system will help to reduce many illegal activities which are held on internet,"{'entities': [{'name': 'Post', 'attributes': ['text', 'author']}, {'name': 'Author', 'attributes': ['username', 'wordbased_user_profiles']}, {'name': 'DiscussionForum', 'attributes': ['url', 'selected']}, {'name': 'Topic', 'attributes': ['title', 'description']}], 'relationships': [{'from': 'Author', 'to': 'Post', 'label': 'created'}, {'from': 'DiscussionForum', 'to': 'Post', 'label': 'hosts'}, {'from': 'System', 'to': 'Post', 'label': 'analyzes'}, {'from': 'System', 'to': 'DiscussionForum', 'label': 'monitors'}, {'from': 'Post', 'to': 'Topic', 'label': 'pertains_to'}]}"

So people come across various reviews in the website but these reviews are genuine or fake is not identified by the user. In some review websites some good reviews are added by the product company people itself in order to make in order to produce false positive product reviews. They give good reviews for many different products manufactured by their own firm. User will not be able to find out whether the review is genuine or fake. To find out fake review in the website this Ã¢ÂÂFake Product Review Monitoring and Removal for Genuine Online Product Reviews Using Opinion MiningÃ¢ÂÂ system is introduced. This system will find out fake reviews made by posting fake comments about a product by identifying the IP address along with review posting patterns. User will login to the system using his user id and password and will view various products and will give review about the product. To find out the review is fake or gen, system will find out the IP address of the user if the system observe fake review send by the same IP Address many a times it will inform the admin to remove that review from the system.

"Data mining is a technique used to mine out useful data and patterns from large data sets and make the most use of obtained results. Web mining and data mining go hand in hand when creating web mining systems. Web mining includes text mining methodologies that allow for usage reading from and classification based on unstructured data. Text mining allows us to detect patterns, keywords and relevant information in unstructured texts. Web mining and data mining systems each have their own uses. Data mining algorithms are efficient at manipulating organized data sets, while web mining algorithms are widely used to scan and mine from unorganized and unstructured web pages and text data available on the internet. Websites created in various platforms have different data structures and are difficult to read for a single algorithm. Since it is not feasible to build a different algorithm to suit various web technology we need to use efficient web mining algorithms to mine this huge amount of web data. Web pages are made up of HTML (Hyper text markup language) In various arrangements and have images, videos etc intermixed on a single web page. So we here propose to use smartly designed web mining algorithms to mine textual information on web pages and detect their relevancy to biomedical sector. In this way we may judge web pages and check their relevancy to the biomedical field. This system proves useful in many biomedical sectors and even search engines to classify web pages into the biomedical structure. Their relevancy to the field help classify and sort them appropriately for the sector.",data mining is a technique used to mine out useful data and patterns from large data sets and make the most use of obtained results web mining and data mining go hand in hand when creating web mining systems web mining includes text mining methodologies that allow for usage reading from and classification based on unstructured data text mining allows us to detect patterns keywords and relevant information in unstructured texts web mining and data mining systems each have their own uses data mining algorithms are efficient at manipulating organized data sets while web mining algorithms are widely used to scan and mine from unorganized and unstructured web pages and text data available on the internet websites created in various platforms have different data structures and are difficult to read for a single algorithm since it is not feasible to build a different algorithm to suit various web technology we need to use efficient web mining algorithms to mine this huge amount of web data web pages are made up of html hyper text markup language in various arrangements and have images videos etc intermixed on a single web page so we here propose to use smartly designed web mining algorithms to mine textual information on web pages and detect their relevancy to biomedical sector in this way we may judge web pages and check their relevancy to the biomedical field this system proves useful in many biomedical sectors and even search engines to classify web pages into the biomedical structure their relevancy to the field help classify and sort them appropriately for the sector,"{

"We propose to build a real estate portal that allows users to post property for sale as well as search sort property and contact its dealers online. It also consists of an innovative feature that allows users to post reviews of the dealing process with a buyer after their deal. This allows the buyers to verify a sellers profile and view his past deal experiences from other user reviews on his profile. Every user on the portal has a profile that can be viewed by to check his past deals status.

A user may post bad reviews about another user he has dealt with if any payment issues are encountered during the deal. So users may now verify that particular user before dealing with him. The system consists of a user login, users may look for property as per area, Bhk, Location as well as other amenities like lift, furnished, semi-furnished etc. The system sorts property and displays results list as desired by user. Users may also post a property for sale along with desired price, location and contact details. The system also consists of a builder login where a builder may login and post his new project for those looking to buy new flats/offices.","we propose to build a real estate portal that allows users to post property for sale as well as search sort property and contact its dealers online it also consists of an innovative feature that allows users to post reviews of the dealing process with a buyer after their deal this allows the buyers to verify a sellers profile and view his past deal experiences from other user reviews on his profile every user on the portal has a profile that can be viewed by to check his past deals status

"Diagnosis centres need to maintain good relations with their clients. There is always a database of clients maintained in every diagnostics centre. The database includes client contact details as well as his tests done. It includes data like contact numbers, name, address, email etc. Clients may conduct various tests at the diagnostic centre including blood test, urine test as well as cholesterol, liver and kidney tests. The system must be capable of evaluating patient bills and providing them in printable format. The system also allows admin to store and update patient data for existing and new patients. Since every client must be working for some or the other organization and many organizations have contracts with diagnostics centre to provide discounts to their employees, the system tracks this information too. Now the system also keeps count of the number of tests undergone by a patient in a year. After 10 tests in a year the system provides 5% discount to the patient from the 11th test in a particular year. The system also allows admin to sort out tests frequency and search particular patient records.

"Getting a loan is a very tiring and complicated process in India. It may take weeks even months for loans to get approved and people have to visit the loan office again and again for document and verification. Here our proposed project automates the loan process from both, bankers as well as customers side. Here customers may see various loans provided along with rate of interest and required documents. Here once the customer fills basic enquiry form, it reaches the bank server he gets a login id password.. The server administrator now can check it and select weather to go forward or reject the candidate. If he needs to go forward the banker may select to send customer to next stage. Now the customer gets stage 1 approval and needs to upload his scanned documents to the site through his login. Once the documents are submitted they are cross verified at the server and reply is sent to server. The system server also gets the person location and his image secretly by tracking the computer through which he submits documents to the bank server needed for bank verification. The bank may now cross verify customer details and also request extra documents by sending online alerts to the customer email. The customer just needs to upload needed documents online and can also track loan status. He gets an sms once his loan has been approved confirming the process.",getting a loan is a very tiring and complicated process in india it may take weeks even months for loans to get approved and people have to visit the loan office again and again for document and verification here our proposed project automates the loan process from both bankers as well as customers side here customers may see various loans provided along with rate of interest and required documents here once the customer fills basic enquiry form it reaches the bank server he gets a login id password the server administrator now can check it and select weather to go forward or reject the candidate if he needs to go forward the banker may select to send customer to next stage now the customer gets stage 1 approval and needs to upload his scanned documents to the site through his login once the documents are submitted they are cross verified at the server and reply is sent to server the system server also gets the person location and his image secretly by tracking the computer through which he submits documents to the bank server needed for bank verification the bank may now cross verify customer details and also request extra documents by sending online alerts to the customer email the customer just needs to upload needed documents online and can also track loan status he gets an sms once his loan has been approved confirming the process,"{'entities': [{'name': 'Customer', 'attributes': ['name', 'email', 'password', 'location', 'image']}, {'name': 'Banker', 'attributes': []}, {'name': 'Loan', 'attributes': ['rate of interest', 'required documents']}, {'name': 'Document', 'attributes': ['scanned document']}, {'name': 'Server Administrator', 'attributes': []}], 'relationships': [{'from': 'Customer', 'to': 'Loan', 'label': 'Can see available loans'}, {'from': 'Customer', 'to': 'Banker', 'label': 'Fills basic enquiry form and gets approval'}, {'from': 'Customer', 'to': 'Server Administrator', 'label': 'Gets login id and password'}, {'from': 'Banker', 'to': 'Customer', 'label': 'Sends customer to next stage for approval'}, {'from': 'Customer', 'to': 'Document', 'label': 'Uploads scanned documents'}, {'from': 'Server Administrator', 'to': 'Customer', 'label': 'Cross verifies customer details and requests extra documents'}, {'from': 'Banker', 'to': 'Customer', 'label': 'Sends online alerts for required documents'}]}"

"Steganography is the technique of hiding private or sensitive information within something that appears to be nothing be a usual image. Steganography involves hiding Text so it appears that to be a normal image or other file. If a person views that object which has hidden information inside, he or she will have no idea that there is any secrete information. What steganography essentially does is exploit human perception, human senses are not trained to look for files that have information inside of them. What this system does is, it lets user to send text as secrete message inside an image file, user uploads the image and enters the text to send secretly, and gives a key or a pass word to lock the text, what this key does is it encrypts the text, so that even if it is hacked by hacker he will not be able to read the text. You will need the key to decrypt the hidden text. User then sends the image and key to the receiver and receiver first opens the image, and then he enters the key or password for decryption of text, he then press decrypt key to get secret text of the sender. By using this method you can double ensure that your secret message is sent secretly without outside interference of hackers or crackers.

"Online ad networks like google, yahoo, adchoices etc advertise their client products and services on search as well as partner websites. So here we concentrate on partner website adposting and handling system. Partner websites are websites that consist of ads by these online advertising networks.

It decides which ad to display on which site and for what time duration. It consists of a strong online database system to manage this entire data. Our proposed project is a simulation of multi website handling by an ad network. We here use an online sql based database for this purpose. The system server is a web based application that is used to input new ads, their schedule and also to edit details as needed. The server system stores all the needed data into the database for further scheduling. The partner websites are constantly monitored and controlled by server system for ad scheduling and updating. As soon as an ad expires the website contacts server for next ad to display. The server then processes the database to check for requirements and provides appropriate response to partner website.

Encryption is commonly used for encryption of text as well as images. Various encryption algorithms exist for this purpose. Here we propose to build a secured image encryption algorithm that can be used to encrypt as well as send images remotely to the intended receiver. Our system can link to remote client to our software installed on remote system and connect to it for image transfer. Our system uses RSA algorithm for this purpose. User may submit his image for encryption. Our system now gets the image and converts it into hex format before being encrypted. Then we use RSA algorithm to encrypt the image for sending through the internet. User may now select the intended user from among the list of users having our software installed. Our system now send the image in an encrypted format through an active internet connection. Even if an attacker gets the file he first has to Decrypt it using proper keys which are not available to him. He then needs to decode the image into proper image format. When image reaches intended receiver he must first enter required keys. On entering the right keys the software decrypts the entire image in original format and provides it to the receiver. Thus we encrypt and securely send images over the internet using secure RSA encryption.,encryption is commonly used for encryption of text as well as images various encryption algorithms exist for this purpose here we propose to build a secured image encryption algorithm that can be used to encrypt as well as send images remotely to the intended receiver our system can link to remote client to our software installed on remote system and connect to it for image transfer our system uses rsa algorithm for this purpose user may submit his image for encryption our system now gets the image and converts it into hex format before being encrypted then we use rsa algorithm to encrypt the image for sending through the internet user may now select the intended user from among the list of users having our software installed our system now send the image in an encrypted format through an active internet connection even if an attacker gets the file he first has to decrypt it using proper keys which are not available to him he then needs to decode the image into proper image format when image reaches intended receiver he must first enter required keys on entering the right keys the software decrypts the entire image in original format and provides it to the receiver thus we encrypt and securely send images over the internet using secure rsa encryption,"{

"It has happened so many times that you have been waiting on airport for someone to arrive and you donÃ¢ÂÂt have any exact information about flight timing and other stuff. So here we present to you a project on flight scheduler system. Using this system userÃ¢ÂÂs can get the information about flight timing, and is it on time or not, and other information. In this system there is an admin module which enters the detail about flights and its timing and these details passes through internet server and is fetched by the system on other airports, and there is other system that shows flight information to the viewers on Airport. Second system will get all the information of all flights but will automatically select the data that refers to particular airport and shows that information on screen. For example if an admin at Mumbai airport enter information about Delhi flight Chennai airport system will not be effected, but Delhi airport system will show the information about flight. This system works like Ã¢ÂÂ when flightparted late from an airport, admin will enter details about departure and its time, this information goes in real time on internet server and retrieved on other system through internet server and shows the details on screen. This second System is installed on various locations on airport for viewers to view the information. Admin will add information like add flight left from airport, expected arrival at destination, delay in the flight schedule, etc. This project publishes real-time flight schedule events to subscribing multiple client applications.",it has happened so many times that you have been waiting on airport for someone to arrive and you dont have any exact information about flight timing and other stuff so here we present to you a project on flight scheduler system using this system users can get the information about flight timing and is it on time or not and other information in this system there is an admin module which enters the detail about flights and its timing and these details passes through internet server and is fetched by the system on other airports and there is other system that shows flight information to the viewers on airport second system will get all the information of all flights but will automatically select the data that refers to particular airport and shows that information on screen for example if an admin at mumbai airport enter information about delhi flight chennai airport system will not be effected but delhi airport system will show the information about flight this system works like  when flightparted late from an airport admin will enter details about departure and its time this information goes in real time on internet server and retrieved on other system through internet server and shows the details on screen this second system is installed on various locations on airport for viewers to view the information admin will add information like add flight left from airport expected arrival at destination delay in the flight schedule etc this project publishes realtime flight schedule events to subscribing multiple client applications,"{

This data is obtained through ip address tracking. The ip addresses issued by internet providers is location dependent. Our systems need to reverse engineer this data in order to get the city of that particular terminal.
We here use a live windows based application as demo ip recorder to capture the ip addresses of terminals. Then we make a reverse lookup to map those ip address into city coordinates. This helps a company to record and track it target customers by plotting them on a map. It help companies take better marketing decisions by checking the geographic spread of their software/product in various cities.

"The Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm is a widely accepted system for data encryption that makes use of a private (secret) key that was judged so hard to break by the U.s. government that it was confined for exportation to different nations. There are more than 71,000,000,000,000,000 (71 quadrillion) encryption keys to be used in this algorithm. For any given message, the key is picked at irregular interval from among this colossal number of keys. Like other private key cryptographic routines, both the sender and the collector must know and utilize a common private key. Many companies, governments, military and other fields make use of DES algorithm for secure data transfer over unsecure networks. We here propose a system for secured data transfer over internet by implementing DES encryption and decryption applications over two remote computers. Our system encrypts data over one end and also transmits data over to the other device. The private key is sent over to the other end as an OTP to his email. The receiver must enter the same key at his end to decrypt the received message accurately. Thus we propose a fully automated secure message transfer system that includes encryption as well as key transfer mechanism embedded in a single application that allows for fast, secure and fully automated message transfer using DES algorithm.",the data encryption standard des algorithm is a widely accepted system for data encryption that makes use of a private secret key that was judged so hard to break by the us government that it was confined for exportation to different nations there are more than 71000000000000000 71 quadrillion encryption keys to be used in this algorithm for any given message the key is picked at irregular interval from among this colossal number of keys like other private key cryptographic routines both the sender and the collector must know and utilize a common private key many companies governments military and other fields make use of des algorithm for secure data transfer over unsecure networks we here propose a system for secured data transfer over internet by implementing des encryption and decryption applications over two remote computers our system encrypts data over one end and also transmits data over to the other device the private key is sent over to the other end as an otp to his email the receiver must enter the same key at his end to decrypt the received message accurately thus we propose a fully automated secure message transfer system that includes encryption as well as key transfer mechanism embedded in a single application that allows for fast secure and fully automated message transfer using des algorithm,"{'entities': [{'name': 'EncryptionAlgorithm', 'attributes': ['DES']}, {'name': 'PrivateSecretKey', 'attributes': ['key']}, {'name': 'Message', 'attributes': ['text']}, {'name': 'Computer', 'attributes': ['computer_id', 'location']}], 'relationships': [{'from': 'EncryptionAlgorithm', 'to': 'PrivateSecretKey', 'label': 'uses'}, {'from': 'EncryptionAlgorithm', 'to': 'Message', 'label': 'encrypts'}, {'from': 'Computer', 'to': 'PrivateSecretKey', 'label': 'has'}, {'from': 'Sender', 'to': 'EncryptionAlgorithm', 'label': 'uses'}, {'from': 'EncryptionAlgorithm', 'to': 'Receiver', 'label': 'decrypts'}]}"

Consists of four routers in four corners of room, based on the Network signaling strength of each wifi router displacement we store this data for further processing. Our proposed system gathers data and accurately maps it using indoor environment is estimated by FMM which is simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) on a grid in order to get the exact mapping position of the mobile device. We propose this system to be built on an android device since it provides a robust mobile development platform. Our system is aimed to help the blind as well as knowing indoor user location in case of smoke or dark environment rooms. The system is built to use wifi signals and map the signal strength locations so as to guide user about his exact location In the indoor environment.","we usually find gps tracking systems to track a android phone location on gmap but what if we run opt of internet connection or gps or what is we want to track our location on a map well here we propose a system that uses wifi signals to exactly track an android phone location in a closed room here we do not need any internet or gps connection to do so

"Courier service providers usually have a very large network across countries. A courier goes through several places including distribution center, aeroplane, ship, road transport etc. At this time even customer is conscious about where has his package reached. The customer can track his courier through a login where he may enter this courier number and track the location status of his package. Here we propose a dedicated courier tracking system where customer may check the status and location of his courier. Here every distribution channel including centre, airport terminal, rail, road terminal has a system operated by authorized people of that particular point of distribution. Each point of distribution has its login access. On login the person needs to make an entry of a package that reaches it. This data is directly uploaded the main system that now keeps track of latest location/status of the package through an active internet connection. The data stored on server can now be used for live package status tracking by customers. Customers may login to the server in order to enter their unique courier tracking number. On entering the number system first gets the last recorded status of that particular package and shows this data to the user. The user may now track his package as and when needed. The system can be further improved by adding a barcode to every package so that every point just needs to scan the barcode instead of doing a manual entry of package number",courier service providers usually have a very large network across countries a courier goes through several places including distribution center aeroplane ship road transport etc at this time even customer is conscious about where has his package reached the customer can track his courier through a login where he may enter this courier number and track the location status of his package here we propose a dedicated courier tracking system where customer may check the status and location of his courier here every distribution channel including centre airport terminal rail road terminal has a system operated by authorized people of that particular point of distribution each point of distribution has its login access on login the person needs to make an entry of a package that reaches it this data is directly uploaded the main system that now keeps track of latest locationstatus of the package through an active internet connection the data stored on server can now be used for live package status tracking by customers customers may login to the server in order to enter their unique courier tracking number on entering the number system first gets the last recorded status of that particular package and shows this data to the user the user may now track his package as and when needed the system can be further improved by adding a barcode to every package so that every point just needs to scan the barcode instead of doing a manual entry of package number,"{

Well for a study and integration of two major technologies together we propose a client server based communication application made by integrating JAVA with dotnet technology. Here we propose a dedicated client server based architecture that allows for chat as well as authoritative commands by the server over client application. We integrate the two technology and have a working communication between these two technologies. We here propose to build the server application using JAVA and the client side application using Dotnet(C#) technology. Our system consists of the server as an authorities admin and client as a client application in Dotnet. The server has the right to start chat, enable disable client application as well as record the client pc screen as and when needed. Thus we integrate two major technologies in a live internet based client server application for robust live internet based communication.",java and dot net are two different but very useful technology when it comes to information technology both of them have different development platforms well for a study and integration of two major technologies together we propose a client server based communication application made by integrating java with dotnet technology here we propose a dedicated client server based architecture that allows for chat as well as authoritative commands by the server over client application we integrate the two technology and have a working communication between these two technologies we here propose to build the server application using java and the client side application using dotnetc technology our system consists of the server as an authorities admin and client as a client application in dotnet the server has the right to start chat enable disable client application as well as record the client pc screen as and when needed thus we integrate two major technologies in a live internet based client server application for robust live internet based communication,"{

"Large libraries usually have thousands of books kept at different locations. It is sometimes tedious to search for book locations. It is also necessary to know weather a book is available or not at the library. So here we propose a tab based system that guides the user at librarian counter itself about book availability as well as book location if book is available. If book is unavailable the tab even guides the user about the book return date so that he may return that exact day. The tab based system allows user to search for books across various categories and check their availability and location at the counter itself.
The system also consists of and admin server/PC used by the librarian to insert data about new books. Update book availability status as well as book location as and when needed. This data is reflected in the tab through a wifi connection. The tab works in coordination with the server PC through a wifi based connection. The system does not need any internet since it works on a local Wifi connection.
The system can be further extended using barcoding system to issue and maintain records just by scanning and no manual entry.","large libraries usually have thousands of books kept at different locations it is sometimes tedious to search for book locations it is also necessary to know weather a book is available or not at the library so here we propose a tab based system that guides the user at librarian counter itself about book availability as well as book location if book is available if book is unavailable the tab even guides the user about the book return date so that he may return that exact day the tab based system allows user to search for books across various categories and check their availability and location at the counter itself

"People now-a-days read news online which has become very popular as the web provides access to news articles from millions of sources around the world. News Recommendation is to select relevant news by their themes. Identifying news based on the topic is critical in this task. News is proposed solely based on the authorÃ¢ÂÂs point of view. In this system we immensely enhance the performance of recommendation. This can be achieved if the user interaction is better utilized. It overcomes the bias of traditional news proposal by suggesting relevant information with a balanced perspective of authors and readers. This is achieved by identifying and using the topic patterns of the original news posting and its comments, one of the most useful records of user behaviors in social media. In particular, to capture the dynamic concerns of users, hidden topic patterns are extracted by utilizing both textual and structural information of comments. Certain keywords from comment is extracted and compared with the keywords whh are already stored in database. To do so, we model the relationship among comments and that relative to the original posting. Our proposed solution provides an effective news recommendation service. As this system takes suggestion of both author and reader, system will help to provide effective news recommendation service. This system uses unique algorithm to develop news recommendation service which is different from the traditional news proposal. This system will help web users to access relevant news articles by their themes.",people nowadays read news online which has become very popular as the web provides access to news articles from millions of sources around the world news recommendation is to select relevant news by their themes identifying news based on the topic is critical in this task news is proposed solely based on the authors point of view in this system we immensely enhance the performance of recommendation this can be achieved if the user interaction is better utilized it overcomes the bias of traditional news proposal by suggesting relevant information with a balanced perspective of authors and readers this is achieved by identifying and using the topic patterns of the original news posting and its comments one of the most useful records of user behaviors in social media in particular to capture the dynamic concerns of users hidden topic patterns are extracted by utilizing both textual and structural information of comments certain keywords from comment is extracted and compared with the keywords whh are already stored in database to do so we model the relationship among comments and that relative to the original posting our proposed solution provides an effective news recommendation service as this system takes suggestion of both author and reader system will help to provide effective news recommendation service this system uses unique algorithm to develop news recommendation service which is different from the traditional news proposal this system will help web users to access relevant news articles by their themes,"{

"Web mining can be termed as an information mining method to naturally search, collect and organize data from indexed online records which might be in various organized, unstructured or semi-organized structure. We usually use web mining techniques in order to assess the viability of a specific web page/entity in order to figure out various factors related to it. This project consolidates the best researched mechanisms from the semantic web and synaptic web at low entropy in order to build structural engineering of Semantic-Synaptic web mining. Our proposed project aims at web mining for finding out density of selected keywords in order to check its keyword prominence on those web pages. This is an important factor in various fields in order to check the prominence of specific keywords and flag websites having over prominence of those keywords. For example this can also be used to detect websites inspiring terrorism.

"TodayÃ¢ÂÂs we usually require systems for auto content updating as per updates on a remote server. Our system allows implementing this mechanism by using an enhanced system. The system is a part of the N2SW(Network to Software) algorithm that allows for effective communication between a network server and remote client using an active internet connection. The algorithm is built for secure and effective communication between client and server machines. The system acts as a web agent between the online server and client machines. The client machine consists of teaching content database. This content is constantly scanned and compared with online version for any updates/variations. Any updates on server are constantly being monitored. An update on server must be instantly reflected on client system. This our server instantly updates for any changes by pinging it and the client thus allows server to transfer the updated set of data to on it. The client does not necessarily be connected to internet all the time. Ifn update occurs and internet connection is disabled, the system waits to get an active internet connection for receiving the update. This allows us to put forth a secure and efficient teaching system that stays updated with server content.",todays we usually require systems for auto content updating as per updates on a remote server our system allows implementing this mechanism by using an enhanced system the system is a part of the n2swnetwork to software algorithm that allows for effective communication between a network server and remote client using an active internet connection the algorithm is built for secure and effective communication between client and server machines the system acts as a web agent between the online server and client machines the client machine consists of teaching content database this content is constantly scanned and compared with online version for any updatesvariations any updates on server are constantly being monitored an update on server must be instantly reflected on client system this our server instantly updates for any changes by pinging it and the client thus allows server to transfer the updated set of data to on it the client does not necessarily be connected to internet all the time ifn update occurs and internet connection is disabled the system waits to get an active internet connection for receiving the update this allows us to put forth a secure and efficient teaching system that stays updated with server content,"{

Various software/gaming applications require exact PC configurations to run on them. Many of the PC users are non technical people who are unaware of their exact PC configuration. So for companies dealing in bulk software it becomes inefficient to manually interact with every customer and thus suggest then pc configurations and suggest the changes then need to do in order to run a particular application in their PC. Well here we propose a solution to this issue by aiming at a pc configuration retriever and configuration suggestion project. The system must first be instructed with various software /gaming applications minimum configuration suggestions. So now whenever a user wants to know whether a software/game will run properly in his PC he does not need to manually check it. The company website will consist of this application which can be downloaded and automatically executes without installation. It now asks the user about the software/game whose compatibility he needs to check with his PC. The application now scans user PC for various pC configuration data and suggests the user of the PC updating he needs to do in order run that particular system in his PC. If configuration meets the needs it suggests that his PC is fir for the application. The software also sends this data with the username to the company so that the company may later stay in contact with the user,various softwaregaming applications require exact pc configurations to run on them many of the pc users are non technical people who are unaware of their exact pc configuration so for companies dealing in bulk software it becomes inefficient to manually interact with every customer and thus suggest then pc configurations and suggest the changes then need to do in order to run a particular application in their pc well here we propose a solution to this issue by aiming at a pc configuration retriever and configuration suggestion project the system must first be instructed with various software gaming applications minimum configuration suggestions so now whenever a user wants to know whether a softwaregame will run properly in his pc he does not need to manually check it the company website will consist of this application which can be downloaded and automatically executes without installation it now asks the user about the softwaregame whose compatibility he needs to check with his pc the application now scans user pc for various pc configuration data and suggests the user of the pc updating he needs to do in order run that particular system in his pc if configuration meets the needs it suggests that his pc is fir for the application the software also sends this data with the username to the company so that the company may later stay in contact with the user,"{

Web usage data is of prime importance these days. Web pages used on a day to day basis and various users logging on to a website are two major data categories of prime importance. Here we propose a web mining algorithm that proves better that most traditional web mining algorithms. We here track web data and use the E web miner algorithm for web log analysis and reporting. The algorithm works on Ecommerce data continuously scanning and going through the web log looking for patterns as suggested by user conditions. The algorithm is designed to look for various patterns that appear to be in any logical order. It is built to provide analytics data according to predefined algorithms built in for maximum performance and minimum processing time.,web usage data is of prime importance these days web pages used on a day to day basis and various users logging on to a website are two major data categories of prime importance here we propose a web mining algorithm that proves better that most traditional web mining algorithms we here track web data and use the e web miner algorithm for web log analysis and reporting the algorithm works on ecommerce data continuously scanning and going through the web log looking for patterns as suggested by user conditions the algorithm is designed to look for various patterns that appear to be in any logical order it is built to provide analytics data according to predefined algorithms built in for maximum performance and minimum processing time,"{'entities': [{'name': 'WebPage', 'attributes': ['url', 'title', 'content']}, {'name': 'User', 'attributes': ['id', 'username', 'email']}, {'name': 'EcommerceData', 'attributes': ['date', 'amount', 'product']}], 'relationships': [{'from': 'WebPage', 'to': 'User', 'label': 'VIEWED_PAGE'}, {'from': 'User', 'to': 'EcommerceData', 'label': 'MADE_PURCHASE'}]}"
"We usually come across fields where web data proves very important for business as well as security analysis. Ecommerce as well as website usage data is of prime importance these days. Our proposed project puts for ward a system that allows a web server to record web data analytics of web usage patterns of various web links. The system is configured to record web page clicks, seo score computed as per a search engine ranking algorithm as well as other parameters associated with the each web page. The server has an inbuilt configuration logic required to scan live web pages similar to crawlers and then record/store that data for later processing. Since the data may be large and huge computational strength is required to store process this data. This computation may lead to overburdening on the server thus hindering its further indexing performance. Thus we propose a client application that communicates with web server to receive this data and allows for processing and manipulation based on this recorded web service data.

We usually come across areas where an admin or department / company head needs to monitor user work. This monitoring helps the authority know about any mal activity or any activity not supposed to be done in office premises is done by the employee. Remote pc monitoring needs a working internet connection that too having a high bandwidth. Well such system when monitoring on a large number of PCÃ¢ÂÂs proves to have a quite reasonable load on the network. Since the system works by sending constant image snapshots of computer screen to intended authority these constant image transfers from a number of computers proves to be quite an unethical practice. So we propose an On Demand Remote PC monitoring system that monitors a PC on authority demand. The system is designed to get a snapshot of a PCÃ¢ÂÂs as and when requested by admin. Moreover since online image transfers are quite heavy on the particular network we use an email server to transfer images. Whenever the server sends a monitoring request the client pc scres captured and transferred to server PC as a snapshot attached to an email. This allows the snapshots to be viewed from anywhere irrespective of the server application installation. Our system thus accomplishes the on demand pc monitoring functionality yet has almost no load on the usable internet bandwidth. The system uses http requests to constantly track and snapshot responses from server. On receiving the request it checks weather it is a request for the same PC. If it is for the same PC and authentic the system now uses the snapshot recorder to get a screen capture of the active screen. The system now sends this screenshot as an email attachment through an email server. The server authority may now receive the snapshot through email and access the emails from any place.,we usually come across areas where an admin or department  company head needs to monitor user work this monitoring helps the authority know about any mal activity or any activity not supposed to be done in office premises is done by the employee remote pc monitoring needs a working internet connection that too having a high bandwidth well such system when monitoring on a large number of pcs proves to have a quite reasonable load on the network since the system works by sending constant image snapshots of computer screen to intended authority these constant image transfers from a number of computers proves to be quite an unethical practice so we propose an on demand remote pc monitoring system that monitors a pc on authority demand the system is designed to get a snapshot of a pcs as and when requested by admin moreover since online image transfers are quite heavy on the particular network we use an email server to transfer images whenever the server sends a monitoring request the client pc scres captured and transferred to server pc as a snapshot attached to an email this allows the snapshots to be viewed from anywhere irrespective of the server application installation our system thus accomplishes the on demand pc monitoring functionality yet has almost no load on the usable internet bandwidth the system uses http requests to constantly track and snapshot responses from server on receiving the request it checks weather it is a request for the same pc if it is for the same pc and authentic the system now uses the snapshot recorder to get a screen capture of the active screen the system now sends this screenshot as an email attachment through an email server the server authority may now receive the snapshot through email and access the emails from any place,"{

"Military access is the most secure access provision and needs to be kept that way considering national security issues. Usual military authentication and authorization techniques consist of one way authentication techniques with just one form of authentication, namely password or smart card or biometric. Here we propose a two stage authentication/authorization technique for secured military access to authorized personnel. The first stage is a card scanning system, each authorized personnel must have a smart card. On card scanning the system also asks of an additional 4 digit code associated with it, on entering the right code the personnel goes to the next stage of authentication. On the next stage, system generates a one time password and sends to the mobile phone registered to that particular card scanned. The personnel now needs to entered the password sent on his mobile phone for the next stage of authentication. After he enters right OTP user is granted access inside. The system is a very secure access mechanism for military and other secure authorization fields. The system may be further improved by adding face recognition authentication of third stage authentication to this system.",military access is the most secure access provision and needs to be kept that way considering national security issues usual military authentication and authorization techniques consist of one way authentication techniques with just one form of authentication namely password or smart card or biometric here we propose a two stage authenticationauthorization technique for secured military access to authorized personnel the first stage is a card scanning system each authorized personnel must have a smart card on card scanning the system also asks of an additional 4 digit code associated with it on entering the right code the personnel goes to the next stage of authentication on the next stage system generates a one time password and sends to the mobile phone registered to that particular card scanned the personnel now needs to entered the password sent on his mobile phone for the next stage of authentication after he enters right otp user is granted access inside the system is a very secure access mechanism for military and other secure authorization fields the system may be further improved by adding face recognition authentication of third stage authentication to this system,"{'entities': [{'name': 'AuthorizedPersonnel', 'attributes': ['smartCard']}, {'name': 'SmartCard', 'attributes': ['4 digit code']}, {'name': 'MobilePhone', 'attributes': []}], 'relationships': [{'from': 'AuthorizedPersonnel', 'to': 'SmartCard', 'label': 'Has'}, {'from': 'SmartCard', 'to': 'MobilePhone', 'label': 'RegisteredTo'}, {'from': 'AuthorizedPersonnel', 'to': 'SmartCard', 'label': 'AuthenticatesWith'}]}"
Our project proposes a secured ATM (Any time Money) system using a card scanning system along with Otp password system on sms for improved security. Usual ATM ssystems do not contain the OTP feature for money withdrawal. If an attacker manages to get hold of ATM card and the pin number he may easily use it to withdraw money fraudently. So our proposed system supports the ATM card scanning system along with an OTP system. Ths user may scan his card and login to the system .But after user is through with this authentication he may view details but is asked to enter OTP as soon as he clicks money withdrawal option. At this stage the system generates and sends a One time password OTP to the registered mobile number to that particular user. The password is generated ad sent to the user mobile phone. He now needs to enter the OTP in the system in order to withdraw money. Thus our system provides a totally secure way to perform ATM transactions with two level security structure.,our project proposes a secured atm any time money system using a card scanning system along with otp password system on sms for improved security usual atm ssystems do not contain the otp feature for money withdrawal if an attacker manages to get hold of atm card and the pin number he may easily use it to withdraw money fraudently so our proposed system supports the atm card scanning system along with an otp system ths user may scan his card and login to the system but after user is through with this authentication he may view details but is asked to enter otp as soon as he clicks money withdrawal option at this stage the system generates and sends a one time password otp to the registered mobile number to that particular user the password is generated ad sent to the user mobile phone he now needs to enter the otp in the system in order to withdraw money thus our system provides a totally secure way to perform atm transactions with two level security structure,"{

"Research laboratories funded by private or government organizations are of strategic importance to a country. A lot of sensitive research is carried on in such laboratories. The confidentiality of such premises is of prime importance for the benefit of the society. At such time it becomes necessary to ensure high level authentication and authorization of personnel entering such facilities. A single form of authentication/authorization is not enough for these sensitive organizations. Here we propose a system that combines two different forms of authentication techniques to ensure only authorized persons access the premises. Our system integrates biometrics with secure card to create a dual secure high end security system never implemented before. The system first checks if the persons face is registered as an authorized personnel in its database. If the face matches, the person is allowed to go to the next stage. At this stage the user needs to scan his card into the system. If the card associated with that user face is scanned, that particular user is then granted access to the system. Else if the authentication fails at even one stage the user is not allowed to enter the premises.",research laboratories funded by private or government organizations are of strategic importance to a country a lot of sensitive research is carried on in such laboratories the confidentiality of such premises is of prime importance for the benefit of the society at such time it becomes necessary to ensure high level authentication and authorization of personnel entering such facilities a single form of authenticationauthorization is not enough for these sensitive organizations here we propose a system that combines two different forms of authentication techniques to ensure only authorized persons access the premises our system integrates biometrics with secure card to create a dual secure high end security system never implemented before the system first checks if the persons face is registered as an authorized personnel in its database if the face matches the person is allowed to go to the next stage at this stage the user needs to scan his card into the system if the card associated with that user face is scanned that particular user is then granted access to the system else if the authentication fails at even one stage the user is not allowed to enter the premises,"{

"Project Title:
University Course Registration System

Project Description:
The University Course Registration System is a web-based platform designed to automate and simplify the process of course enrollment for students in a university setting. It enables students to browse available courses, view seat availability, register or drop courses, and check schedule conflicts in real-time.

The system also supports academic advisors and faculty by providing tools to set prerequisites, approve or deny course selections, manage class capacities, and monitor enrollment trends.

This project reduces the paperwork and confusion of manual registration, enhances academic planning, and ensures fairness and transparency in course allocation.

Key Features:
1. Student Dashboard
View eligible courses for the current semester

Search and filter courses by department, faculty, schedule, etc.

Add/drop courses before deadlines

Real-time updates on seat availability

Visual weekly timetable builder

2. Course Management (Admin/Faculty)
Add new courses and update course details

"Post-Investment Support and Grievance Management System
Project Description:
The Post-Investment Support and Grievance Management System is a dedicated digital platform where existing investors in Bangladesh can raise concerns, seek post-approval services, and get institutional support from BIDA. It ensures that investment-related bottlenecks—such as customs delays, utility issues, regulatory conflicts, or land problems—are resolved in a structured and timely manner.

This system strengthens investor satisfaction and retention by providing continuous engagement even after an investment is made.

Key Features:
1. Investor Support Ticketing System
Investors can log complaints, service requests, or policy-related issues.

Each ticket is assigned a unique ID with real-time tracking.

2. Categorized Grievance Types
Utility (electricity, water, gas)

Customs/port clearance delays

Tax/VAT issues

Land allocation or leasing delays

Regulatory permissions or inspections

3. Departmental Routing
Grievances are automatically routed to relevant ministries, agencies, or BIDA focal points.

Escalation matrix if responses are delayed beyond SLA (Service Level Agreement) timeframes.

4. Status Updates & Communication
Email/SMS notifications for ticket acknowledgment, response, and resolution.

Two-way communication panel between investor and BIDA officials.

5. Investor Feedback System
Post-resolution rating and feedback form to assess issue handling quality.

Data used for performance monitoring of government services.

6. Internal Dashboard for BIDA
Track unresolved cases, resolution timelines, and department-wise backlogs.

Filter cases by investment region, sector, or severity.

7. Document and Evidence Upload
Investors can attach supporting documents, photos, or scanned letters for context.

BIDA officials can respond with circulars or clarifications.

8. Analytics and Heatmaps
Identify recurring issues by agency or location.

Provide monthly reports to ministries and departments for systemic improvements.

9. Confidential Escalation Channel
Option for sensitive issues to be raised directly to senior BIDA leadership.

Anonymous reporting for corruption, discrimination, or harassment cases.

10. Multilingual Support and Mobile Access
Support for both Bangla and English.

Mobile-responsive design for easier access by SMEs and rural investors.

" Digital FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Monitoring and Analytics System
Project Description:
The Digital FDI Monitoring and Analytics System is a centralized digital platform that enables BIDA to track, analyze, and report on all foreign direct investment inflows in Bangladesh. It helps monitor project implementation stages, fund disbursement, employment generation, and sectoral contributions in real time.

The system supports data-driven policymaking by providing visual dashboards, predictive trends, and investment outcome analysis based on region, sector, and investor origin.

Key Features:
1. FDI Project Registration & Profiling
Every FDI project registers with detailed metadata (country of origin, sector, funding amount, implementation timeline).

Each project receives a unique tracking code.

2. Fund Inflow Tracking
Monthly, quarterly, or milestone-based updates on fund disbursement.

Integration with Bangladesh Bank data (where possible) to validate remittance figures.

3. Implementation Progress Reporting
Investors or project managers update project progress (site development, equipment import, hiring).

BIDA verifies and validates through monitoring visits or third-party reports.

4. Sectoral and Geographical Analysis
Visual dashboards show sector-wise and division-wise FDI inflow.

Breakdown by country of origin, type (Greenfield, Brownfield, JV, M&A), and project scale.

5. Predictive Investment Analytics
Use historical data to forecast trends in key sectors.

Identify high-potential countries or underinvested regions for targeted promotion.

6. Job Creation & Impact Metrics
Track number of direct and indirect jobs created by FDI.

Include women employment, technology transfer, and local supply chain engagement metrics.

7. Risk & Delay Alerts
Flag projects at risk of delays, underperformance, or partial implementation.

Alert BIDA officers for follow-up or escalation.

8. Integration with Other BIDA Systems
Pull data from One Stop Service (OSS), Grievance System, and Licensing Portal.

Unified investor view across departments.

9. Export and Reporting Engine
Generate reports for BIDA leadership, Parliament, international development partners, and media.

Export in PDF, Excel, or interactive web formats.

10. Secure, Role-Based Access
Access rights based on user role (BIDA admin, project lead, analyst).

Data security and audit trail features included.",,"{
